# Energy Forecasting Project

This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Structure

- `data/` — Contains the energy dataset.
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
- `models/` — Trained machine learning models.
- `src/` — Source code for preprocessing and model training.
- `main.py` — Entry point for running the pipeline.
- `requirements.txt` — List of required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
